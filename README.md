# PODS_Capstone
Principles of Data Science Capstone Project:

-This is my final project from the Principles of Data Science course. I was given a data set of 52,000 songs from Spotify, each song categorized with 10 different features. I was tasked with gathering a better understanding of what makes a song popular and the audio features that go along with each song.

-This repository contains the data set used and the code used to perform the analysis in Google Colab.

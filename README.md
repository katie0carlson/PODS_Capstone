# PODS_Capstone
Principles of Data Science Capstone Project:

-For this project, I was given a data set of 52,000 songs from Spotify and tasked with gathering a better understanding of what determines song popularity. Each song is categorized by Spotify with 10 different features. After my investigation and analysis, I created a comprehensive report, complete with my findings and figures to illustrate these findings.

-This repository contains the initial data set, the code used to perform the analysis, and the final report.

# PODS_Capstone
Principles of Data Science Capstone Project:

-For this project, I was given a data set of 52,000 Spotify songs and tasked with gathering insights into the key determinants of a song's popularity. In addition to the primary song identifiers (such as artist(s) and album name), this data set contains a popularity score and 10 other features pre-determined by Spotify. Some of these features include the duration of a song in milliseconds, the average loudness in decibels, and the tempo in beats per minute. Other features are measured on a scale of 0 to 1, such as the level of speechiness (spoken words) or acousticness (percentage of acoustic instruments). After my investigation and analysis, I created a comprehensive report, complete with my findings.

-This repository contains the initial data set (csv file), the code used to perform the analysis (ipynb file), and the final report (pdf).
